# StudentManagment

This project is developed with a range of modern architectural patterns and technologies.
It utilizes the Onion Architecture with Unit of Work and Generic Repository patterns,
along with FluentValidation for validation and a well-structured service layer. 
The project is designed to be robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## Features

- **Onion Architecture**: Implements a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Unit of Work & Generic Repository**: Provides a pattern for managing database transactions and data access with reusable repository classes.
- **FluentValidation**: Uses FluentValidation for declarative validation of business logic and data models.
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic and provides a clear API for interacting with the underlying data layer.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   cd repository
2.Running **update-database** in the **Package Manager Console** will be sufficient.
